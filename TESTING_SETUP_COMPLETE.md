#### ✅ Feature Tests (`features.spec.js`)
- Student/Teacher/Admin dashboards
- Quiz system (start, answer, results)
- Concept map interactions
- Navigation between sections

#### ✅ Utility Tests (`utils.spec.js`)
- API error handling
- Responsive design
- Accessibility checks

- Error page handling

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Using Test Runner Scripts
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./run-tests.sh -t smoke
./run-tests.sh -t auth -b chromium
./run-tests.sh -t all --ui

# Windows
run-tests.bat -t smoke
run-tests.bat -t auth -b chromium
run-tests.bat -t all --ui
```

### Specific Test Types
```bash
# Run only smoke tests
npx playwright test smoke.spec.js

# Run only authentication tests
npx playwright test auth.spec.js

# Run only feature tests
npx playwright test features.spec.js

# Run only utility tests
npx playwright test utils.spec.js
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure:

1. **Backend server** is running on port 5000
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Frontend server** is running on port 3000
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **MongoDB** is running and accessible

## 📊 Test Reports

After running tests, view detailed reports:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Reports include:
- Test results and timing
- Screenshots of failures
- Video recordings
- Execution traces

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new test file: `tests/newFeature.spec.js`
2. Use helper functions from `testHelpers.js`
3. Add test data to `testData.js` if needed
4. Follow existing patterns

### Modifying Test Data
Edit `tests/fixtures/testData.js` to:
- Add new test users
- Modify mock API responses
- Update test concepts/quizzes

### Configuring Browsers
Edit `playwright.config.js` to:
- Add/remove browsers
- Change viewport sizes
- Modify timeouts
- Adjust retry settings

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Page not found" errors**
   - Ensure frontend server is running
   - Check if application loads in browser

2. **API call failures**
   - Ensure backend server is running
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify API endpoints

3. **Element not found**
   - Add `data-testid` attributes to elements
   - Use `page.waitForSelector()` for dynamic content
   - Check if selectors are correct

4. **Authentication issues**
   - Clear browser storage between tests
   - Verify mock API responses
   - Check JWT token handling

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run tests in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test auth.spec.js --debug
```

## 📈 CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`) will:
- Install dependencies
- Start servers
- Run tests
- Upload test reports and artifacts

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run your first test**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

2. **Customize tests** for your specific needs

3. **Add more test cases** as you develop new features

4. **Set up CI/CD** by pushing to GitHub

5. **Monitor test results** and fix any failures
